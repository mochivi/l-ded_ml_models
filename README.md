### My Mechanical Engineering Final Thesis

This code was developed to quickly test multiple configurations of CNN architectures and parameters. The objective is to develop a  machine learning model that is able to predict the width of the deposited line based on the images of the melt pool only. The manufacturing process is Laser Directed Energy Deposition, a form of additive manufacturing that is able to be applied to metals.
